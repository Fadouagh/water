1) Objective
- To detect and process tweets on drinking-water incidents via mining the social media
- To develop a systematic method to analyse and classify water-related media on the web

2) Expected results
- a standalone social sensor for water issues in North Africa
- collected data

3) Schedule

February 2019

- mining tweets (French and Arabic) using Twitter api
- Pre-processing of the data (urls, extract place names from the tweet text, etc.)

March 2019

- Natural language processing of French text using regular expressions, nltk, wrod2vec 

April 2019

- Recruiting new member
- Collecting more data

May 2019

- Ayoub Hitana has joined the team

June 2019

- Ayoub --> collecting data from acredited organization (SONEDE, etc.)
- Fadoua --> word embedding model 

July 2019

- Ayoub --> collecting data from acredited organization (SONEDE, etc.)
- Fadoua -->  making water corpus / tweet classification (various ML algorithms and DL)

August 2019
